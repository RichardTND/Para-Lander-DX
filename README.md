# Para-Lander-DX
Fun arcade parachute lander game for the Commodore 64. 

Para Lander DX originally started as Para Lander for the Cassette 50 Charity competition run by PhoenixWare and the RGSquad. The competition version of the game was fully constructed on theC64. Later after the competition was finished, the 2K version of the game was transformed into a full game, where everything was developed on a theC64 full size computer using native C64 related applications. The game was then transfered to cross-assembly format which supports Turbo Assembler (64TASS).

# More about the game
Para Lander DX is a simple hi score attack challenge which consists of 16 different levels. You control a parachutist who has to jump out of the plane (fire to jump). Then he must land safely onto each and every landing pad. If he hits the passing airships, or falls into the water, a life is lost. There is also a bonus timer, in which gives you extra points for completing a level. The game is over when the player loses all of its lives or the time runs out. There are 16 levels in total to complete.
