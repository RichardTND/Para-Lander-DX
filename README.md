# Para-Lander-DX
Fun C64 Arcade game programmed in Turbo Macro Pro Assembler and ported to 64TASS format

Requirements:

* An IDE that can handle code and run batch files

* 64TASS (Cross platform 6502 code compiler)
 
* Exomizer V3.1.1 (Or use PuCrunch)
 
* VICE C64 emulator (For testing)

Use makepara.bat to build and run the project (make sure paths are correct).

Have loads of fun.
